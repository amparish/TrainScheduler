# TrainScheduler

### Overview

This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Using Moment.js, the app retrieves and manipulates this data - data including arrival time, frequency at which the train arrives at the station, and minutes until the next arrival. Some example data is already provided, and the app allows for user input to add new trains to the list.
